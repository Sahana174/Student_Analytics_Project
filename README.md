# üéì Student Performance Analytics Project

## Overview
This project analyzes student performance data using **Python**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**.  
It helps identify academic trends such as:
- Average marks by subject  
- Relationship between attendance and marks  
- Pass vs Fail distribution

##  Files Included

| File Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **student_scores.csv** | Raw dataset containing student ID, subject, marks, attendance, and pass/fail status. |
| **analyze_scores.py** | Python script that loads, cleans, and analyzes the dataset. |
| **student_summary.xlsx** | Summary Excel file (average marks and attendance per subject) generated by Python. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used
-  **Python (Pandas, OpenPyXL)** ‚Üí For data cleaning and summary calculations  
-  **Excel** ‚Üí For verifying and formatting summary data  
- **Power BI** ‚Üí For building interactive visual dashboards

## Steps Performed
1. Created `student_scores.csv` (raw data).  
2. Used `analyze_scores.py` to clean data and calculate averages.  
3. Verified results in **Excel**.  
4. Imported cleaned data into **Power BI**.  
5. Built visuals:
   - Clustered Column Chart ‚Üí Average Marks per Subject  
   - Scatter Plot ‚Üí Attendance vs Marks  
   - Donut Chart ‚Üí Pass vs Fail Ratio  
6. Exported dashboard as PDF (`Student_Performance_Dashboard.pdf`).

## Insights
- Higher attendance leads to better marks.  
- Science has the highest average marks.  
- Most students passed, but Math shows improvement areas.
